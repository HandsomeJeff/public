"""
.. module:: encrypted_block

Higher level code interfaces with ``encrypted`` so that it does not have to deal
with ECC stuff.  We write or read a large block at a time (maybe 64 MB say).
When writing we generate all the ECC information, and when reading we will
use ECC to recover lost information so user sees whole block still.

We have to go to disk. The normal mode is probably that there are a few machines that
are slow and the rest move along. We want to get the backup secure as soon as possible.
It can be secure even if 5 to 10 suppliers are not finished yet.  But this could be
a lot of storage, so we should be using disk.

We want to generate a pool of writes to do, and put in more as it gets below some
MB limit. But we should not be limited by a particular nodes speed.

The ``packet`` will have all the info about where it is going etc.
We number them with our block number and the supplier numbers.

Going to disk should let us do restarts after crashes without much trouble.

Digital signatures and timestamps are done on ``encrypted_blocks``.
Signatures are also done on ``packets``.

RAIDMAKE:
    This object can be asked to generate any/all ``packet(s)`` that would come from this ``encrypted_block``.
RAIDREAD:
    It can also rebuild the ``encrypted_block`` from packets and will
    generate the read requests to get fetch the packets.

class Block:
    """
    A class to represent an encrypted Data block.
    The only 2 things secret in here will be the ``EncryptedSessionKey`` and ``EncryptedData``.
    Scrubbers may combine-packets/unserialize/inspect-blocks/check-signatures.

    CreatorID              http://cate.com/id1.xml  - so people can check signature - says PK type too
    BackupID               Creator's ID for the backup this packet is part of
    BlockNumber            number of this block
    EncryptedData          data may have some padding so multiple of crypto chunck size
                           and multiple of #nodes in eccmap (usually 64) for division
                           into packets
    Length                 real length of data when cleartext (encrypted may be padded)
    LastBlock              should now be "True" or "False" - careful in using
    SessionKeyType         which crypto is used for session key
    EncryptedSessionKey    encrypted with our public key so only we can read this
    Other                  could be be for professional timestamp company or other future features
    Signature              digital signature by Creator - verifiable by public key in creator identity
